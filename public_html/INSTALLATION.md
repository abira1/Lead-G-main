    echo "Appointments table accessible: " . $result['count'] . " records";
} catch (Exception $e) {

## üîí Security Checklist

### Immediate Actions After Installation:

1. **Change Admin Password**
   - Login to admin panel
   - Go to your database via phpMyAdmin
   - Run this SQL to change password:
   ```sql
   UPDATE admin_users 
   SET password = '$2y$10$YOUR_NEW_HASHED_PASSWORD' 
   WHERE email = 'toiral.dev@gmail.com';
   ```
   - Use online bcrypt generator to hash your new password

2. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Uncomment lines in `.htaccess` to force HTTPS:
   ```apache
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
   ```

3. **Protect Config Files**
   - Verify `config/.htaccess` exists and denies access
   - Test by visiting: https://leadgenerationg.com/config/database.php
   - Should show "403 Forbidden"

4. **Delete Installation Files**
   - Delete `INSTALLATION.md` after setup
   - Delete `database.sql` after import
   - Delete any test files
