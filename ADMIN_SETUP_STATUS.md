# 🎯 **ADMIN USERS ADDITION - CURRENT STATUS**

## 📧 **Requested Admin Users:**
- ✅ `toiral.dev@gmail.com` 
- ✅ `mdrudra60@gmail.com`

## 🔍 **Current Status:**

### ✅ **What's Already Done:**
1. **Firebase Configuration** - Project properly set up
2. **Authentication System** - Both email/password and Google Sign-In enabled
3. **Security Rules** - Database properly secured to `admin_users` only
4. **Frontend Integration** - Admin login component ready
5. **Admin Panel** - Full admin dashboard deployed at https://lead-g-final.web.app/admin

### ⚠️ **What's Needed:**
Both users exist in Firebase Authentication but need to be added to the `admin_users` database collection.

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (Choose One Method):**

### **Method A: Firebase Console (5 minutes)**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/lead-g-final/authentication/users
2. Find both users and copy their UIDs
3. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/lead-g-final/database
4. Add them to `admin_users` collection with their UIDs as keys

### **Method B: Let Me Help You**
If you want me to help you through the Firebase Console steps, just say:
- "Help me add them through Firebase Console"
- Or share the UIDs if you can see them

### **Method C: Automatic Script** 
I can create a more advanced script if you provide Firebase Admin credentials.

## 🔐 **Temporary Login Info:**

While setting up, these are the temporary passwords I set:
- `toiral.dev@gmail.com`: `TempPassword123!`
- `mdrudra60@gmail.com`: `TempPassword456!`

**Note**: They should change these after first login.

## 📋 **After Adding to Database:**

Both users will be able to:
- ✅ Login via https://lead-g-final.web.app/admin
- ✅ Use email/password authentication 
- ✅ Use Google Sign-In (if their Google account matches)
- ✅ Access full admin panel features:
  - Manage appointments
  - Manage testimonials  
  - Manage companies
  - View contacts
  - Upload files
