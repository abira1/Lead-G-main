# Worked With Section Fix - Resolution Report

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Companies logos not displaying on homepage - empty gray box shown

## üêõ Problem Identified

The "Companies We've Worked With" section on the homepage was showing an empty gray container instead of company logos.

### Root Cause
- Missing `/app/frontend/.env` file
- The `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable was undefined
- Frontend was trying to fetch from `undefined/api/worked-with` which returned HTML error page
- This caused a JSON parsing error: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Created Frontend Environment File
**File:** `/app/frontend/.env`

```env
# Backend API URL
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://pricing-harmony.preview.emergentagent.com

# Environment
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 2. Restarted Frontend Service
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend
```

## üéâ Result

‚úÖ **Companies logos are now displaying correctly!**

### Verification Screenshots:
1. Company logos visible: IBM, Adobe, Salesforce, Netflix, Tesla, Meta, Amazon
2. Animated scrolling carousel working properly
3. 18 visible logo instances (12 unique companies duplicated for seamless scrolling)
4. No console errors related to API fetching

### API Status:
- ‚úÖ Backend endpoint working: `GET /api/worked-with`
- ‚úÖ Frontend successfully fetching data
- ‚úÖ 12 companies loading correctly
- ‚úÖ Logo images rendering properly

## üìã Technical Details

### Environment Variable Discovery
```bash
# Found the preview endpoint from environment
env | grep preview
# Output: preview_endpoint=https://pricing-harmony.preview.emergentagent.com
```

### Component Flow
1. `WorkedWith.jsx` component fetches from `${process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}/api/worked-with`
2. Backend returns JSON array of 12 companies
3. `LogoLoop` component renders logos in animated scroll
4. Each logo includes: company name, logo URL, website URL

## üîç Before vs After

### Before:
- ‚ùå Empty gray container
- ‚ùå Console errors: "Error fetching companies: SyntaxError"
- ‚ùå API endpoint undefined

### After:
- ‚úÖ Company logos displaying
- ‚úÖ Smooth scrolling animation
- ‚úÖ All 12 companies visible
- ‚úÖ No console errors

## üìù Files Modified

1. **Created:** `/app/frontend/.env`
   - Added `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` with production URL
   - Set environment to production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For Future Deployments:
1. Always ensure `.env` file exists in frontend directory
2. Use the correct preview/production endpoint URL
3. Restart frontend service after environment changes
4. Verify the backend URL format includes `https://` protocol

### Environment URLs:
- **Local Development:** `http://localhost:8001`
- **Production/Preview:** `https://pricing-harmony.preview.emergentagent.com`

## ‚úÖ Status: RESOLVED

The "Companies We've Worked With" section is now fully functional and displaying all 12 company logos correctly on the homepage.

**Next Steps:** None required - issue fully resolved.
